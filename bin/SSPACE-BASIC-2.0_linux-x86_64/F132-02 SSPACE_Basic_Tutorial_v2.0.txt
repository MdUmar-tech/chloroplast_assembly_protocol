SSPACE Basic
Tutorial
getting started
============================
Download and obtaining data
--------------------Download the E.coli 200bp paired-end read data from
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SRR001665
Download both .fastq files and store them on disk. For this example, we
place the two datasets in the 'example' folder which is present in the
SSPACE .zip file.
In the 'example' folder, a contig datasets is present. This file is generated
by assembling the E.coli 200bp paired-end dataset with ABYSS, and
contains only contigs larger or equal to 100 basepairs.
In the same folder, a library file is available. This library file describes the
datasets and distances between the reads for each library. Multiple
libraries are allowed, here only is described. Each column per library
should be seperated by a space. In the file 'library.txt' library is described
for the E.coli 200bp paired-end dataset. Each column is described
below;
-First column contains a desired name, here we take 'ecoli'.
-Second and third columns are the datasets.
-Fourth column is the mean distance between the paired reads, which is
200.
-Fifth column is a deviation of the mean distance that is allowed, here we
take 0.75. This means that any pair having a distance between 150 and
250 is allowed.
-The final column is a value to indicate whether to take reverse
complement of the reads (usually the case for mate pair data). We set
this to 0, so no reverse complement;
Before running SSPACE, set your current working directory to the
'example' directory(cd (path_to_SSPACE)/example) were both the library
file and the contig sequences are stored.

We perform scaffolding on the ABYSS contigs, without extending them.
To run SSPACE without contig extension, -x should be set to 0. Here we
run SSPACE with a minimal number of five links (-k 5) and a ratio less
than 0.7 (-a 0.7). If a contig pair satisfy these two parameters, they are
considered for scaffolding.
perl (path_to_SSPACE)/SSPACE_v2-0.pl -l libraries.txt -s
contigs_abyss.fa -k 5 -a 0.7 -x 0 -b ecoli_scaffolds_no_extension
A number of files and folders are generated.
The main file is the 'ecoli_scaffolds_no_extension_summaryfile.txt'. This
file contains information of the final scaffolds, e.g. number of scaffolds,
N50 and scaffold statistics. Also, you can see how many paired reads
failed to map to contigs, and how many paired reads are used for
scaffolding.
The final scaffolds in .fasta format and an .evidence file are outputted in
the current working directory. The evidence file shows all the contigs
present on each scaffold.

Running SSPACE with extension
--------------------To run SSPACE with contig extension, -x should be set to 1. Here, the
minimal overlap of the reads with the contigs should at least be 30 bases
(-m 30). The miminal number of reads needed to extend a contig is set to
20 (-o 20).
perl (path_to_SSPACE)/SSPACE_v2-0.pl -l libraries.txt -s
contigs_abyss.fa -k 5 -a 0.7 -x 1 -m 30 -o 20 -b
ecoli_scaffolds_extension
If there are contigs extended, you can view the information in the
'ecoli_scaffolds_extension_summaryfile.txt' file. Information is provided
about the number of contigs that are extended and the number of reads
that are used.
The sequences of the extended contigs are stored in the
'intermediate_results' folder. For each contig it is indicated if it has been
extended or not.

Visualise scaffolds
--------------------To make a .dot file for visualisation, the -p option should be set to 1.
perl (path_to_SSPACE)/SSPACE_v2-0.pl -l libraries.txt -s
contigs_abyss.fa -k 5 -a 0.7 -x 0 -p 1 -b ecoli_scaffolds_no_extension
A .dot file is generated in the 'dotfiles' folder. To convert the file to any
desired format, GraphViz should be downloaded at www.graphviz.org.
Once installed, the .dot file can be converted to a .ps file with;
dot -Tps2 (dotfile.dot) -o visualisation_scaffolds.ps
where 'dotfile.dot' stands for the produced .dot file. The output is a .ps
file named 'visualisation_scaffolds.ps', containing the scaffolds and its
contigs. For more information see the help file of dot.
