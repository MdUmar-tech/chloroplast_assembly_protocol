What is SSPACE?
--------------To start; SSPACE is not a de novo assembler, it is used after a preassembled run. SSPACE is a script to extend and scaffold preassembled contigs using a number of mate pairs or paired-end libraries.
It uses Bowtie to map all the reads to the pre-assembled contigs.
Unmapped reads are used for extending, if desired, the pre-assembled
contigs with the SSAKE assembler. Again Bowtie is used to map the
reads to the extended contigs. Positions and orientation of the reads are
stored and used for scaffolding. If both reads of a pair are found within
the allowed distance, they are used for scaffolding to determine the
orientation, contig pairing and ordering of the contigs.
Why SSPACE?
--------------SSPACE can be used for a number of reasons;
- A pre-assembly was performed with single reads, generating contigs.
The user now has additional data, like mate pair data, and wants to use
these data to extend and scaffold the contigs.
- A pre-assembly was performed with, for example, mate pair data of 1
kb insert size, generating contigs. The user now has additional data with
larger insert size. The user wants to include the data for extending and
scaffolding the contigs.
- A pre-assembly was performed with mate pair data on an assembler,
generating contigs. The assembler, however, has no scaffolder. Inserting
the contigs, along with the mate pair data, still can scaffold the contigs.
How to use SSPACE scaffolder?
--------------SSPACE scaffolder comes with a number of files.

Each column is explained in more detail below;
Column 1:
--------Name of the library. A short name to keep track of the names of the
libraries. All temporary files and summary statistics are named by this
library name. Libraries having same name are considered to be of same
distance and deviation (column 4 and 5). In addition, these libraries with
similar names are use for the same scaffolding iteration. Libraries should
be sorted on distance, the first library is scaffolded first, followed by next
libraries.
Column 2 & 3:
--------Fasta or fastq files for both ends. For each paired read, one of the reads
should be in the first file, and the other one in the second file. The paired
reads are required to be on the same line. No naming convention of the
reads is required, because names of the headers are not used in the
protocol. Thus names of the headers shouldn’t be the same and do not
require any overlap of names like (…).x and (…).y, which is commonly
used in assembly programs.
During the reading step, the sequences of both pairs are merged
together and filtered for;
-Mapping. the filtered read pairs with only ACGT characters and no
duplicates are used. The remaining merged read pairs are split to single
reads, and are mapped to contigs.
-Extension. only unmapped single reads are used for extension of the
pre-assembled contigs.
-Scaffolding. Besides the filtering of mate pairs containing “N” and nonACGT character, duplicate mate pair sequences are also removed.

Concluding, each read should be larger than 16 (or the ‘–m’ parameter if
-x 1). If they are shorter, the program will simply omit them from the
whole process.
If at the second column "TAB" (mind the capitals!) is set, the third
column is considered as a Tabulated text file containing positions of
read-pairs on contigs. The format is;
<ctg1>

<start1>

<end1>

For example;
contig1
100 150 contig1
contig1
4000 4050 contig2

<ctg2>

<start2>

<end2>

350 300
110 60

Some notes about TAB files;
1).
If Tab file is inserted;
- no filtering (-z option) of the contigs will be applied
- contigs will not be extended if -x option is set.
Both features can not be used, since otherwise the positions of the reads
on the contigs are not correct.
2).
It is possible to include multiple different TAB libraries and combination
of tab library with normal .fasta/.fastq files.
3).
The contigs in the TAB files are required to be the same as the names in
the inserted contig file (-s option). Names of the contigs are splitted on
spaces, so a contig name like '>contig1 cov300' will be 'contig1'. 'contig1'
should thus be the name of the contig in the TAB file.
See the README for more information about how the TAB file works.
See the TUTORIAL on how to convert a SAM or BAM file to a .tab file.
Column 4 & 5:
--------The fourth column represents the expected/observed inserted size
between paired reads. The fifth column represents the minimum allowed
error. A combination of both means e.g. that with an expected insert size

of 4000 and 0.5 error, the distance can have an error of 4000 * 0.5 =
2000 in either direction. Thus pairs between 2000 and 6000 distance are
valid pairs.
Column 6:
--------The final column indicates the orientation of the paired-reads.
Orientations can be: FF, FR, RF or RR. Where the F stands for -->
orientation, and R for <-- orientation. Orientation of FR thus means that
the pairs are: --><-MAIN PARAMETERS:
The ‘-s’ contigs fasta file
--------------The ‘–s’ contigs file should be in a .fasta format. The headers are used
to trace back the original contigs on the final scaffold fasta file.
Therefore, names of the headers should not be too complex. A naming
of “>contig11” or “>11”, should be fine. Otherwise, headers of the final
scaffold fasta file will be too large and hard to read.
Contigs having a non-ACGT character like “.” or “N” are not discarded.
They are used for extension, mapping and building scaffolds. However,
contigs having such character at either end of the sequence, could fail
for proper contig extension and read mapping.
The ‘-x’ contig extension option
--------------Indicate whether to do extension or not. If set to 1, contigs are tried to be
extended using the unmapped sequences. If set to 0, no extension is
performed.
EXTENSION PARAMETERS:
The ‘–m’ minimum overlap
--------------Minimum number of overlapping bases of the reads with the contig
during overhang consensus build up. Higher ‘-m’ values lead to more
accurate contigs at the cost of decreased contiguity. We suggest to take
a value close to the largest read length. For example, for a library with
36bp reads, we suggest to use a -m value between 32 and 35 for reliable

contig extension. For more information, see the SSPACE README file
or the SSAKE paper/poster.
The -o number of reads
--------------Minimum number of reads needed to call a base during an extension,
also known as base coverage. The higher the ‘-o’, the more reads are
considered for an extension, increasing the reliability of the extension.
The ‘-t’ trimming option
--------------Trims up to ‘-t’ base(s) on the contig end when all possibilities have been
exhausted for an extension. See SSAKE help files for information.
The ‘-u’ unpaired single reads
--------------Unpaired reads can be inserted for contig extension. These reads are
not used for scaffolding.
The ‘-r’ minimal base ratio
--------------Minimum base ratio used to accept a overhang consensus base. Higher
'-r' value lead to more accurate contig extension.

SCAFFOLDING PARAMETERS:
The ‘-k’ minimal links and ‘-a’ maximum link ratio
--------------Two parameters control scaffolding (-k and -a). The -k option specifies
the minimum number of links (read pairs) a valid contig pair must have to
be considered. The -a option specifies the maximum ratio between the
best two contig pairs for a given contig being extended. For more
information see the .readme file or the poster of SSAKE.
The ‘-n’ contig overlap
--------------Minimum overlap required between contigs to merge adjacent contigs in
a scaffold. Overlaps in the final output are shown in lower-case
characters.

The ‘-z’ minimal contig
--------------Minimal contig size to use for scaffolding. Contigs below this value are
not used for scaffolding and are filtered out. Larger contigs produce
more reliable scaffolds and also the amount of scaffolds is vastly
reduced. Smaller contigs (< 100bp) are likely to be repeated elements
and can stop the extension of the scaffold due to exceeding the -a
parameter.

BOWTIE MAPPING PARAMETERS:
The '-g' maximum gaps
--------------Maximum allowed gaps for Bowtie, this parameter is used both at
mapping during extension and mapping during scaffolding. This option
corresponds to the -v option in Bowtie. We strongly recommend using no
gaps, since this will slow down the process and can decrease the
reliability of the scaffolds. We only suggest to increase this parameter
when large reads are used, e.g. Roche 454 data or Illumina 100bp.
The '-T' number of threads
--------------Number of search threads for mapping reads to the contigs with Bowtie.
See the Bowtie (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml) for more
information.

ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS:
The ‘-p’ plot option
--------------Indicate whether to generate a .dot file for visualisation of the produced
scaffolds.
The ‘-b’ prefix base name
--------------All files start with the ‘-b’ prefix to allow for multiple runs on the same
folder without overwriting the results.
